# Enterprise IT Support Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs designed to build practical skills in Windows Server administration, Active Directory, Group Policy, DHCP/DNS, and modern device management (MD-102 / Intune). The labs simulate a small enterprise environment and are suitable for learning, practicing, or showcasing IT support and system administration skills.
