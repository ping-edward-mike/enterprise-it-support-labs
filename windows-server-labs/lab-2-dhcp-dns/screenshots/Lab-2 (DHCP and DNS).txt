- first set the virtual switch to `private switch lab`
- install and configure DHCP (its pretty straight forward)
- to verify its configured check the dashboard and you we see `DHCP`

- Configure DHCP :
 Tools > DHCP > ipv4 (Right Click) and go to [New Scope] to configure DHCP

- Configure DNS :
 

- Created a new VM Win11-01
- Install Windows 11 OS
- Configured Domain to join `ine.local` and renamed it to `Win11-01`

# Clean-ups

- re-design diagrams remove default-gateway as its now private, and remove connection to router
- add a comment : switch adapter to default external to allow internet or updates, but keeping this lab private for lab purpose and not to overlab with my home ip addresses.
- update images/diagrams
